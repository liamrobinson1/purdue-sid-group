Landon Abboud
=============

"Outside of research, I enjoy exploring new things, which mainly comes in the form of traveling, climbing, music, and cooking. I am also an amateur scuba diver and weather buff! I am a big fan of 80's rock music and have spent the past few years teaching myself how to play the guitar."
