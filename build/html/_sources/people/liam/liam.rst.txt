Liam graduated with a BS in AAE from Purdue in December 2022 and is currently pursuing a MS/PhD with Dr. Frueh. His work focuses on recovering shape and attitude information from unresolved optical measurements -- also known as light curves. He is funded by a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship Program (NDSEG) scholarship. In his spare time, he likes rock climbing and non-rock cooking.
